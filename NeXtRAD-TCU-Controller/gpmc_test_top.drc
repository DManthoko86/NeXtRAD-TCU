WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net UDP_1GbE_inst/CONTROL1<13>
   is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the
   CE pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net UDP_1GbE_inst/CONTROL0<13>
   is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the
   CE pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
